Diabetic Retinopathy is a human eye disease that causes
damage to the eye's retina and may ultimately result in complete
blindness. Early detection of diabetic retinopathy is needed to
avoid complete blindness. Physical tests, such as visual acuity test,
dilation of pupils, optical consistency tomography, is used to detect
diabetic retinopathy. However, it is costly in terms of time and
might affect the patients. In these consequences, this paper detects
the presence of Diabetic Retinopathy in the human eye using a
machine learning algorithm. The proposed method applies
classification algorithms on several features (e.g., optical disk
diameter, lesion-specific (microaneurysms, exudates) or presence
of hemorrhages) of an existing Diabetic Retinopathy dataset. Then
the features were extracted and used for the final decision making
to predict the presence of diabetic retinopathy. The proposed
system used Decision Tree, Logistic Regression. Support Vector
Machine for the prediction. The proposed method achieved 88%
accurate results which is much better than the existing works.
Moreover, the proposed method achieves a better score in
precision and recall which are 97% and 92%, respectively
compared to the existing result 72% and 63%, i.e., more the 25%
in each category on average which proves the enormousness of the
proposed method.
